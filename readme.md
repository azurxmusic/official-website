yeah this is my website

I took a lot of inspiration from https://www.phritzmusic.com/#port, as I liked the minimalist design of everything

a lot of my own design came about through little accidents and just seeing something that i tested out that i thought would look cool

the main things i wanted to keep was:
1) a minimalist design and approach
2) focus on aethetic mainly as I wanted to follow the final project guidelines but also make it my own thing in a way, something i'd use and upkeep
3) make something that i can easily build on

some issues i had and how i solved:

1) I didn't want the homepage to have a navbar right away, as i wanted the viewer to scroll down a bit after the initial header.
    I was seeing that one of the easiest ways to make a navbar appear was to do javascript coding to "search" for a specific thing before
    triggering something, and my javascript is honestly kind of horrible right now as I mostly reformat off of previously existing code whenever I do it,
    so I used AI to help me get the code together and then i restructured it to my tastes after. 
        It definitely took me awhile even using AI as I just feel guilty using it for anything so I tried my best to actually learn off of what it was giving me
        rather than just taking everything it regurgitates out for me.
